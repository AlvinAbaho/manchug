                        The University of Manchester supports developmental programs through collaborations with
                        institutions in Uganda. <br><br> Some of the activities conducted support collaboration between
                        the University and institutions of learning in Uganda. For example, between 20th to 23rd June
                        2017, Professor Andrew Masters from the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science at
                        the University of Manchester visited Kyambogo University and Makerere University to discuss
                        collaborations in areas of teaching, research, joint project developments, staff and students
                        exchange programs, capacity building among others.
